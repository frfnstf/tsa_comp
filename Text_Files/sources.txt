TensorFlow Model:
    When coding our TensorFlow Model, we used the website below to learn more about Keras Tuner, a feature we implemented in our model.
    https://github.com/keras-team/keras-tuner

    The website below was also used to gain an idea of image classification and the syntax needed.
    https://keras.io/examples/vision/image_classification_from_scratch/

Disease Info:
    The corpus containing information for each crop disease was gathered from a combination of multiple sources.
    Each text file states the source of the information for the corresponding crop disease.
    Most of our information was retrieved from one of the following websites:
        https://pddc.wisc.edu/fact-sheet-listing-all/
        https://intermountainfruit.org/dbm/
        https://extension.umn.edu/solve-problem/plant-diseases
        https://ipm.ucanr.edu/agriculture/#gsc.tab=0

Software:
    Windows 11 (WSL)
    Ubuntu 2404.1.66.0
    Visual Studio Code
    Python 3.12.3
    As for libraries/frameworks, we installed tkinter, tensorflow, keras-tuner, nltk, pandas, matplotlib, cryptography, and pillow for this program.


GPU Usage:
    We used the YouTube video below to learn how to utilize the built-in dedicated graphics card (NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Laptop GPU) when creating our program.
